Mobile App Developer
Modo
Vancouver, BC
$58,000 a year - Full-time, Permanent
WHAT YOU – OUR MOBILE APP DEVELOPER – WILL DO
Working collaboratively with a cross-functional team, you will develop and maintain Modo’s platform for the sharing of vehicles. Specifically, you will build features and create beautiful and effective user interfaces for the new mobile app.
Requirements. We’ll be honest, you’re unlikely to get the job unless you have most of the following skills and experience:
1+ years work experience in mobile app development – React Native is preferred, but native and other hybrid mobile development experiences are also welcome
experience consuming RESTful APIs
experience working with versioning systems in a production environment
a degree in Computer Science or equivalent experience, e.g. 2+ years of software development
It would be awesome, though, if you had these too:
work experience with Typescript
work experience with PHP or a similar language like C++, C#, Java, or Ruby
work experience in a SQL database environment
experience working within an Agile/Scrum software development team
ATTRIBUTES WE ARE LOOKING FOR
Just as valuable as technical skills are qualities that would help you be successful in this role. We would love to welcome you to our team if you have:
the ability to be self-directed and to be collaborative – our team is working remotely but we meet virtually daily for standups and other sprint events;
a service-oriented attitude and willingness to pitch in – we believe that teammates should have each others’ backs
a technical mindset with creativity, critical thinking skills, and exceptional attention to detail – this is a coding job, after all!
the ability to translate technical concepts for non-technical folks – we encourage each developer to present their user stories to a broader group of stakeholders at sprint reviews
an awareness of new technologies, and the foresight to know when to use them vs. proven solutions – newer isn’t always better, but it’s also not always worse
some lived experience that gives you a different perspective from the way things are “always done”
HOW TO APPLY AND WHAT TO EXPECT – PLEASE READ CAREFULLY
Here’s how to show us your chops! Please email with: jobs@modo.coop
A link to your GitHub (or similar) repo page, or an equivalent code sample as an attachment. If you were part of a team, please describe your individual contribution. It would be helpful if your repo includes a working mobile app (but we understand this isn’t always possible).
Your resume that indicates your level of experience with our wish list of requirements.
We score all our applicants against each of our Requirements to ensure that our screening process is consistent and transparent. Please ensure your resume shows how you match these Requirements.
We appreciate and respect your effort in reaching out to us and will do our best to keep you informed throughout the recruitment process.
As an employer committed to equity, diversity, and inclusion, Modo especially welcomes applications from folks identifying with historically, persistently, and/or systemically underrepresented groups – if that speaks to you, you’re invited to let us know when you email us with your resume and code sample.
We wish you the best with your application and can’t wait to learn more about you!
