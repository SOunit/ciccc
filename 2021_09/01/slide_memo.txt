// computer
input, process, output for the future.

// function of computer
1. take data
2. store data
3. process and convert data
4. generate output
5. control of each steps

// computer contents
computer is HARD WARE and SOFT WARE

// hardware = touchable
- monitor
- mouse
- keyboad
- data strage
- hard drive disk
- system unit
    - graphic cards
    - sound cards
    - memory
    - motherboard
    - chips

// Input device
to communicate in human way with computer
- keyboard
- mouse
- remote control
- joystick
- touch screen
- scanner
- graphic tablet
- microphone
- digital camera
- webcams
- light pens

// central processing unit (CPU)
brain of the computer

// CPU 3 parts
1. Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
    execute all arithmetic and logical operations
    - calculation
    - compare
2. Control Unit (CU)
    1. read code to execute next
    2. increment program counter to point next line
    3. read whatever data
    4. provide data for ALU
    5. give order to hardware
3. Registers
    store data to execute

// Primary Memory
1. RAM = Random Access Memory
    save temporary data
2. ROM = Read Only Memory
    save permanent data
    no overwriting, not allowed to modified
    u-bootとかの書き換え不要なデータの保存に使う

// Secondary Memory
remains data after power off
1. HD = hard drive
    large data
    relatively fast
2. Optical Disk Drive = ODD
    use laser light
    large data than floppy disk ( 1.44MB )
    - CD (700 MB)
    - DVD(8.4 GB)
    - Compact discs
    - Blu-ray(50GB)
3. Flask disk
