[QA]
1. less data from redux 
- toolkit 
- shallow equal? for useSelector
- re-select? for less data?

2. less render 
- toolkit 
- export default memo(Snack)

[MoodApp / change to redux toolkit]
- redux/toolkit has default debug setting!!

[NPM i error]
- legacy-peer-deps for old package

[data-type]
<button
data-type={mood}
>

submitHandler = () => {
    const mood = e.target.dataset.type;
}

[Redux toolkit]
- simplify bootstrap part of redux
- build-in redux-thunk, nice!
- for mutate states
- build-in re-select
- action creator API

[easy refactor of redux toolkit]
- createStore(moodReducer)
- configureStore({reducer: moodReducer})

[createAction]
- 

[createReducer]
# problems
- no mutation
- big switch

# solution
- use createReducer

# sample
const reducer = createReducer(INITIAL_STATE, actionsMap);

// no switch!
moodReducer = createReducer(INITIAL_STATE, {
    // old
    [updateMood]: (state, action) => {
        ...state,
        mood: action.payload
    },
    // new
    [updateMood]: (state, action) => {
        state.mood = action.payload
    },
}, 
// matcher = filter function
[], 
// 
(state)=>state)

// TS good?

// immer for direct mutation of state

// slice
- slice of state

// slice image
{[reducer], [reducer]} = ONE_GIANT_STATE_OBJECT

const sliceObject = createSlice({
    name: 'strawberry-shortcake',
    initialState: INITIAL_STATE,
    reducers: {
        // object of case reducers
    }
})


[syntax option]
// createReducer
// createSlice
