    <h1>
      VOLLEYBALL VICTORY<br />CLAREMORRIS GIRLS WIN ALL-IRELAND TITLE IN STYLE
    </h1>
    <p>
      Victory seemed unlikely. Mount Saint Michael were two sets down and St.
      Leo’s certainly had the upper hand in the third set, dominating 9 points
      to 2. Each time St. Leo’s scored, they pounded the ground in unison,
      further intimidating an already shaky Claremorris team. So how, in these
      circumstances, did they snatch victory from the jaws of almost certain
      defeat?
    </p>

      The first set seemed to suggest two teams who were equally matched.
      Michael’s fought point for point against a Leo’s team whose defence was
      almost impenetrable, yet Edel Nolan managed to hit home some impressive
      spikes. However, as the set drew to a close, they found themselves unable
      to finish the job and St Leo’s stormed into the second set with a 25-22
      win in the first set under their belt.

      This is where it all went wrong for Claremorris. Having lost the first
      set, their nerves took over and their difficulty settling into the match
      was evident in a plethora of unforced errors, despite excellent
      positioning by Nikki Hanley and impact substitutions by Lisa McGreal and
      Jackie Prendergast. They lost the second set 25-19 and hope began to fade
      for their 200+ supporters.

      The third set began in similar fashion but sensing that they now had
      nothing to lose – except of course the All-Ireland Title – the team lifted
      their game tremendously, aided by the now deafening cries of their
      desperate supporters, led by Lisa Brett and Chloe Hughes. Strategic use of
      time outs by coach Fionnghuala King saw the girls finally settle into the
      match. She no doubt reminded them of their team mantra – no matter how
      badly things seem to be going ‘don’t lose your marbles’. Stephanie Mellet
      had a great run of serves and made a stunning save at this crucial point
      in the set. Aisling Croghan made some unbelievable hits from the wings and
      Edel Nolan shone as the driving force behind Mount St Michael’s incredible
      comeback. They won the third set 25-16 and St Leo’s game began to fall
      apart.

    <p>
      A fear of losing now defined their play, and they frequently only used two
      of their three hits, eager to simply get the ball across the net.
      Meanwhile, Claremorris grew in confidence, scoring a resounding victory in
      the fourth set 25-13.

      As it finally dawned that Claremorris could actually win this match, the
      excitement and tension in the arena reached fever pitch, and the daddies
      on the sideline (Gerry Croghan & Con Nolan) riled up the crowd, ably
      assisted by vice-principal Margaret Burke. However, St Leo’s finally
      realised that it was still all to play for and once again their defence,
      led by Sinead Ruth, became near-impossible to break down. Edel Nolan made
      three excellent spikes in a row only to find each and every one returned.
      Long rallies defined the 5th and final set (first to 15 points but the
      team must win by 2 points) and every time Claremorris inched ahead St
      Leo’s reeled them in again. Finally, however, they reached 14 – 13 and
      faced their first match point. Sinead Croghan, whose strength was such a
      defining feature of her play up to this point, unfortunately hit the serve
      long and it was back to stalemate. Two more match points followed, but
      Mount St Michael couldn’t seem to finish Leo’s off. At last, with 2 sets
      all and 17-16 on the scoreboard, Nikki Hanley served, raced forward to set
      the ball and Edel Nolan spiked the girls to the sweetest victory of their
      lives. No wonder, then, she was named Most Valuable Player of the match.
